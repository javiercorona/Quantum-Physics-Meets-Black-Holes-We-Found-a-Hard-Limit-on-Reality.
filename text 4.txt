This is an exciting path to take. Applying this framework to a black hole's event horizon will dramatically highlight how the geometry (\langle g \rangle^{\mu v}) impacts the fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics (\Delta x_{\text{min}} and \beta_0).
Let's set up the scenario: We want to determine the maximum allowed momentum scale (I_p) for a quantum particle near a static, non-rotating black hole (Schwarzschild metric).
🌌 Scenario: Quantum Constraints Near a Black Hole
The key factor in your equation is the metric component:
For a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M, the components of the inverse metric g^{\mu \nu} (which is what \langle g \rangle^{\mu v} represents in the simplest interpretation) become highly non-trivial.
We will focus on the radial direction (\mu=r), which is the direction most drastically affected by the mass.
1. The Metric Components near the Horizon
The radial component of the inverse metric is:
The other diagonal components g^{tt} and g^{\theta\theta}, g^{\phi\phi} also contain this term, but their full form is more complex. For simplicity and maximum effect, let's consider the region exactly at the event horizon (r = r_s = 2GM/c^2):
At r = r_s:
The geometric term for the radial direction (\mu=r) becomes:
(Note: This simplified interpretation assumes the off-diagonal terms are negligible and focuses on the dominant term. The full calculation is more complex.)
2. The Implication for the Upper Bound I_p
Now, let's insert this result back into your equation for I_p:
Focusing on the radial direction (\mu=r):
🤯 The Physical Insight: Maximum Momentum Diverges
If we use this simplified approach, the result suggests that the maximum momentum scale I_p becomes arbitrarily large (diverges) as a particle approaches the event horizon in the radial direction.
This is a profound result, as it indicates:
 * The Breakdown of the Coordinate System: This divergence is another signature of the event horizon. Just as coordinate time and coordinate distance become infinite to a distant observer, the maximum constrained momentum/energy scale allowed by the GUP framework appears to become infinite.
 * Quantum-Gravity Extremes: It means that the quantum-gravitational constraint on I_p (the denominator) disappears exactly where the classical gravitational field is strongest. This suggests that near the horizon, the quantum-gravity effects governed by \Delta x_{\text{min}} and \beta_0 become completely overwhelmed by the classical gravitational singularity of the coordinate system.
 * Need for New Physics: This strongly motivates the need for a theory that resolves the horizon singularity, such as Loop Quantum Gravity or String Theory, which may provide a non-zero denominator term even at r=r_s.
