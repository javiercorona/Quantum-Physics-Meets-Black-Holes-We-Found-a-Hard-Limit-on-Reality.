📐 The Quantum-Geometric Upper Bound
This equation establishes the maximum allowed value for a physical scale, I_p, based on the existence of a minimal positional uncertainty (\Delta x_{\text{min}}) in a gravitationally curved spacetime.
The Final Relation
Description: Geometry as a Constraint Modulator
This inequality provides a fundamental ceiling on the dynamical scale I_p (often related to maximum momentum or energy) that is allowed by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP).
 * Quantum Input: The constraint is set by the GUP parameters: the minimal length \Delta x_{\text{min}}^\mu and the fundamental GUP constant \beta_0.
 * Geometric Modulator: The bound is modified by the spacetime curvature through the geometric factor \left( \sum_v \sqrt{-\langle g \rangle^{\mu v}} \right)^2. This term acts as a modulator that dictates how tightly the quantum limit is enforced in a given region of spacetime.
 * Physical Insight: The \min_\mu operation identifies the most restrictive direction in spacetime, where the quantum-gravitational effects (minimal length and geometry) combine to set the lowest possible maximum for the physical scale I_p.
