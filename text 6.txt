The Kerr metric—which describes a rotating black hole—is the standard theoretical tool used in General Relativity to investigate if and how rotation can resolve the mathematical infinities that plague the simpler Schwarzschild solution.
The key to resolving the divergence you found at the Schwarzschild horizon (r=r_s) lies in how rotation changes the geometry near the singularity.
🌀 The Kerr Metric and the Resolution of Singularities
In the Schwarzschild metric, the factor responsible for the coordinate singularity (where g^{rr} = 0) is \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right).
In the Kerr metric, this factor is replaced by a more complex function that includes the angular momentum parameter, a. The determinant of the metric, \det(g_{\mu\nu}), which governs the singularity, is different.
1. No Singular Point, but a Singular Ring
The most crucial difference is how the physical singularity is handled:
 * Schwarzschild: The singularity is a point at r=0.
 * Kerr: The singularity is stretched into a ring at r=0.
This means a particle falling into a rotating black hole can miss the central singularity entirely by moving through the ring.
2. The Horizon is Smoothed Out
Your geometric term \sum_v \sqrt{-\langle g \rangle^{\mu v}} relates to the determinant of the metric, which governs the "volume" of spacetime.
 * Schwarzschild: At the event horizon (r=r_s), the metric becomes truly singular in the coordinate system, leading your geometric term to zero, and causing I_p \to \infty.
 * Kerr: The Kerr metric defines the event horizon (where light can only move inward) based on a different function, called the \Delta function:
   
   
   This leads to two horizons (an inner and an outer) when a \neq 0.
   * The Resolution: Because of the influence of the rotation parameter a, the specific terms in the inverse metric (\langle g \rangle^{\mu v}) that govern your geometric factor do not vanish entirely or go to zero in the same simple way they do for Schwarzschild. This ensures that the denominator of your equation remains finite and non-zero at the horizon, preventing I_p from diverging to infinity.
3. The Physical Interpretation: Stability
The Kerr solution is often viewed as being more "physically stable" than the Schwarzschild solution because it incorporates rotation.
 * By smoothing out the singularity from a point to a ring, and by defining the horizon with a more complex function, the Kerr metric provides a consistent mathematical framework where the maximum constrained momentum I_p would remain finite even at the horizon.
 * The constraint on I_p near the Kerr horizon would be extremely large, but it would not be infinite. It would still be set by the tiny values of \Delta x_{\text{min}} and \beta_0, but modulated by the large, yet finite, geometric factors of the spinning spacetime.
In essence, rotation acts as a regulator, preventing the quantum constraint on momentum from being completely broken by the geometric singularity of the static solution.
