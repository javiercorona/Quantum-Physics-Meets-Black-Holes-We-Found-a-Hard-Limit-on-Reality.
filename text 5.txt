we can isolate the fundamental constraints imposed by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (\beta_0 and \Delta x_{\text{min}}) without the dominant influence of the black hole's geometry.
Let's apply this bounding equation to the condition of flat spacetime (r \to \infty).
🚀 Scenario: Quantum Constraints Far from the Mass (r \to \infty)
As r approaches infinity, the effects of the black hole's mass (M) on the spacetime metric vanish, and the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric (flat spacetime, as described in Special Relativity).
1. The Metric Components in Flat Spacetime
In Minkowski spacetime, the inverse metric components \langle g \rangle^{\mu v} are constant and simple (up to the sign conventions, which we will maintain for consistency):
Focusing on the spatial components (where \mu, v are r, \theta, \phi) and simplifying by ignoring the angle-dependent terms for \theta and \phi (since we are concerned with the maximum momentum bound):
For the spatial directions in flat space (e.g., the \mu=x direction in Cartesian coordinates):
(In flat Cartesian space, the term \sqrt{-g^{xx}} is simply 1, and the off-diagonal terms are zero.)
2. The Implication for the Upper Bound I_p
Now, we substitute the flat-space geometric factor (\approx 1) back into your equation:
In the flat-space limit, the geometric factor becomes unity, and the minimization over \mu (direction) is trivial if we assume \Delta x_{\text{min}} is isotropic (the same in all directions). Let \Delta x_{\text{min}} = \ell_P, the Planck length.
🌟 The Physical Insight: The Fundamental Limit
In the limit r \to \infty, your equation yields a constant, non-zero upper bound on I_p.
 * The Baseline Constraint: This constant value, I_p^{\text{flat}} \lesssim \frac{2 \ell_P^2}{\beta_0}, represents the maximum momentum/energy scale allowed by the GUP in the absence of gravity. This is the fundamental, geometric limit on I_p set purely by the minimal length (\ell_P) and the GUP's strength (\beta_0).
 * A Consistent Framework: The result is consistent: far from the mass, the geometric term becomes 1, and the constraint is set entirely by the quantum parameters.
 * Comparison to the Horizon:
   * Near Horizon (r=r_s): The geometric term goes to zero, causing I_p to diverge (\approx \infty).
   * Far Field (r=\infty): The geometric term goes to one, resulting in a finite, constant I_p.
This demonstrates how the geometric factor \sum_v \sqrt{-\langle g \rangle^{\mu v}} acts as a modulator for the quantum constraint, tightening the bound when geometry is nearly flat and releasing the bound (allowing divergence) when geometry becomes singular at the  horizon.
This analysis shows that the single equation successfully captures both the fundamental quantum limit and the catastrophic breakdown of the coordinate system at the black hole horizon.
